So I get off stage right? Drop the mix
Walk up to these hot chics, and I'm like:
Sup ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12 baby
They're all like, "Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock"
### that's vulgar ###
